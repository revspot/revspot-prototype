// Diagnostic Spot workflows — Scale · Optimize · Test New Angles.
//
// The mental model is "Claude does the heavy lifting, the human approves
// once". So each workflow has only THREE steps, not four-or-more:
//
//   1. clarify  — Spot asks 2-3 quick questions to lock the brief,
//                 user verifies. On the right pane, a Brief card fills
//                 in as questions get answered.
//   2. plan     — Spot autonomously runs the analysis (memory.read +
//                 personas.fetch + creative.audit + competitor.scan +
//                 plan.build, all in parallel) and presents ONE plan
//                 with a time-phased structure (Week 1 / Week 2 / Week
//                 3, what Spot will do, what it'll observe, the
//                 decision points and guardrails). User approves once.
//   3. live     — Plan is running. Canvas shows the active phase, the
//                 timeline, and recommendations Spot has surfaced for
//                 human approval (those also feed the dashboard).
//
// This file holds:
//   · Clarifying questions per workflow kind
//   · Time-phased plan templates per workflow kind
//   · Pending recommendations Spot surfaces during live execution
//   · Step ordering + labels + tool-call narration + intro messages
//
// All copy is Guyju's-themed (EdTech) so the demo holds together.
